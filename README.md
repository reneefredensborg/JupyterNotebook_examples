## Examples

Here, we present an example of how JupyterLab can be used together with Binder to create an interactive webplace to run already prepared Jupyter Notebooks. This could be highly relevant for course work, where the students have to play around with data analysis/processing, but with already provided data of small size (alternatively, the notebook would have to download data from cloud and access in a different manner).
